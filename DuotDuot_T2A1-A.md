1. **Describe the architecture of a typical Flask application**  
A Flask application usually consists of a project directory that contains the application code, configuration files, templates, static assets, and other related resources.At the core of the application, Flask provides the basic infrastructure for handling web requests, routing, and managing the application's lifecycle. It is responsible for managing the application context, request-response handling, and serving static files.Flask uses routes to map specific URLs to functions called view functions or endpoints. These view functions are responsible for handling requests and returning responses. Routes are defined using decorators, allowing developers to specify the URL pattern and HTTP methods.The views in a Flask application contain the business logic for handling requests and generating responses. They typically interact with the database, process data, and render templates to generate dynamic content.Flask uses a template engine, such as Jinja2, to separate the presentation logic from the application logic. Templates are HTML files with placeholders for dynamic data. The view functions pass data to the templates, which are then rendered and sent as responses to the client.Flask applications often incorporate models to represent the application's data and interact with the database. Models are usually implemented using an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library like SQLAlchemy, which provides an abstraction layer for database operations.  
2. **Identify a database management system (DBMS) commonly used in web applications (including Flask) and discuss the pros and cons of this database**
