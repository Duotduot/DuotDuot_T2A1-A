1. **Describe the architecture of a typical Flask application**  
A Flask application usually consists of a project directory that contains the application code, configuration files, templates, static assets, and other related resources.At the core of the application, Flask provides the basic infrastructure for handling web requests, routing, and managing the application's lifecycle. It is responsible for managing the application context, request-response handling, and serving static files.Flask uses routes to map specific URLs to functions called view functions or endpoints. These view functions are responsible for handling requests and returning responses. Routes are defined using decorators, allowing developers to specify the URL pattern and HTTP methods.The views in a Flask application contain the business logic for handling requests and generating responses. They typically interact with the database, process data, and render templates to generate dynamic content.Flask uses a template engine, such as Jinja2, to separate the presentation logic from the application logic. Templates are HTML files with placeholders for dynamic data. The view functions pass data to the templates, which are then rendered and sent as responses to the client.Flask applications often incorporate models to represent the application's data and interact with the database. Models are usually implemented using an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library like SQLAlchemy, which provides an abstraction layer for database operations.  
2. **Identify a database management system (DBMS) commonly used in web applications (including Flask) and discuss the pros and cons of this database**  
One commonly used database management system (DBMS) in web applications, is PostgreSQL. PostgreSQL is a powerful and open-source relational database system that offers several advantages, but also has some limitations.  
**Pros**  
- **Reliability & Stability** PostgreSQL is known for its robustness and stability. It has a reputation for being a reliable choice for handling critical data in web applications.  
- **Advanced Features** PostgreSQL offers a wide range of advanced features, such as support for complex queries, indexing mechanisms, stored procedures, and user-defined functions. These features enable developers to implement complex data operations efficiently  
- **Scalability** PostgreSQL can handle large amounts of data and high concurrent user loads. It supports parallel processing, which allows it to efficiently distribute the workload across multiple processors or cores  
**Cons**  
- **Complexity** Its advanced features and capabilities require developers to invest time in understanding and mastering its intricacies.  
- **Memory Usage** PostgreSQL can consume significant memory resources, especially when dealing with large datasets or complex queries.  
- **Administration** Managing and configuring PostgreSQL may require more effort and expertise compared to simpler databases. Tasks like setting up replication, backups, and fine-tuning performance parameters might require advanced knowledge. 
3. **Discuss the implementation of Agile project management methodology**  
Agile follows an iterative approach, breaking down the project into smaller increments called "sprints" or "iterations." Each iteration focuses on delivering a working product increment. This allows for regular feedback and adaptability to changing requirements.Agile promotes cross-functional teams comprising individuals with diverse skill sets. These teams collaborate closely throughout the project, fostering effective communication, knowledge sharing, and a sense of collective ownership.The project requirements are captured in a prioritized list known as the product backlog. This backlog is continuously refined and adjusted as new information and feedback emerge, enabling the team to adapt and reprioritize their work.Agile methodologies emphasize close collaboration with stakeholders, including customers and end-users. Their feedback is actively sought throughout the development process, ensuring that the product meets their evolving needs and expectations.  
4. **Provide an overview and description of a standard source control workflow**
